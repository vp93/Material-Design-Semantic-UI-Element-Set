# Material-Design-Semantic-UI-Element-Set
This is a UI set created using material design philosophies, and in conjunction with semantic-ui ( an open source  UI framework )   Using semantic-UI's  inbuit responsive grid layouts and material designs clean and minimalist animations to  provide dynamic content restructuring makes for a pretty interesting combination. And they look nice together too, IMO.  Cheers !
